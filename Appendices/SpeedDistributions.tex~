\lhead{\emph{Appendix: Alternative speed distributions}}
In this appendix we list some alternative speed distributions used in Chapter~\ref{chapter:nufloor}. Halos with double power law density profiles, such as the NFW profile, can have their high velocity dependence better reproduced if a distribution is chosen of the form~\cite{Stadel:2008pn},
\begin{equation}
f_{\rm DPL}({\bf v}) = \left\{
\begin{array}{llrr}
 \frac{1}{N}\left[\exp{\left(-\frac{\vesc^2-v^2}{kv_0^2}\right)}-1\right]^k &	\ \text{if $|{\bf v}|<\vesc$\,,}  \\
0   		& 	\ \text{if $|{\bf v}|\geq \vesc$\,.}
\end{array}\right.
\end{equation}
This model is a modification of the SHM which is recovered when setting $k=1$. Results from N-body simulations suggest $k$ to be in the range $1.5<k<3.5$~\cite{Busha:2004uk,Lisanti:2010qx}. In Ref.~\cite{Ling:2009eh} it was found that the Tsallis model produced a better fit to simulations which included baryons. It involves a speed distribution of the form, 
\begin{equation}
f_{\rm Tsallis}({\bf v}) = \left\{
\begin{array}{llrr}
 \frac{1}{N}\left[1-(1-q)\frac{v^2}{v_0^2}\right]^{1/(1-q)} &	\ \text{if $|{\bf v}|<\vesc$\,,}  \\
 0  		& 	\ \text{if $|{\bf v}|\geq \vesc$\,.}
\end{array}\right.
\end{equation}
with best fit index, $q = 0.773$. The final speed distribution we consider is one introduced by Mao \etal~\cite{Mao:2012hf,Mao:2013nda}. Which was found to improve the fit in simulations. It takes a form characterised by an index $p$,
\begin{equation}
f_{\rm Mao}({\bf v}) = \left\{
\begin{array}{llrr}
 \frac{1}{N}\,e^{-v/v_0}\left(\vesc^2-v^2\right)^p &	\ \text{if $|{\bf v}|<\vesc$\,,}  \\
0   		& 	\ \text{if $|{\bf v}|\geq \vesc$\,.}
\end{array}\right.
\end{equation}
Where results from the Rhapsody and Bolshoi simulations give $p$ in the range $0<p<3$.
